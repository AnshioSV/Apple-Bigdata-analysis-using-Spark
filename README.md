# Apple-Bigdata-analysis-using-Spark
This project implements a robust data processing pipeline in Databricks using Python and Spark. It includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for processing data stored in CSV and Delta table formats, performing key transformations, and loading results into either Databricks DBFS or an Amazon S3 bucket, depending on the configuration.
