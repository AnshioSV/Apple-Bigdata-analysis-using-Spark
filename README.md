Data Processing Pipeline in Databricks
This project implements a robust data processing pipeline in Databricks using Python and Spark. It includes ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for processing data stored in CSV and Delta table formats, performing key transformations, and loading results into either Databricks DBFS or an Amazon S3 bucket, depending on the configuration.
Project Structure
The pipeline includes the following main components:
•	Extractors: Extract data from CSV or Delta table formats.
•	Transformers: Perform data transformations, including complex calculations like identifying purchase patterns.
•	Loaders: Load transformed data into Databricks DBFS or Amazon S3, depending on the specified storage location.
Key Classes
•	Extractor Classes: Fetch data from different sources (CSV, Delta tables) based on specified conditions.
•	Transformation Classes: Apply transformations on extracted data, implementing key business logic.
•	Loader Classes: Manage data loading into target destinations using a LoaderFactory to handle conditions for loading to DBFS or S3.
o	DBFS Loader: Saves data into Databricks DBFS.
o	S3 Loader: Uploads data to an Amazon S3 bucket using access key and secret key for authentication.
Setup
Requirements
•	Databricks Cluster: Set up a cluster in Databricks with Spark enabled.
•	S3 Access (Optional): For S3 loading, configure AWS access and secret keys using Spark configurations:
python
Copy code
spark.conf.set("fs.s3a.access.key", "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>")
spark.conf.set("fs.s3a.secret.key", "<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>")
spark.conf.set("fs.s3a.endpoint", "s3.amazonaws.com")
Running the Pipeline
1.	Data Extraction:
o	Use extractors to read data from CSV files or Delta tables into DataFrames.
2.	Data Transformation:
o	Two primary transformations:
1.	Lead and Lag Transformation: Identifies customers who purchased AirPods after purchasing an iPhone.
2.	CollectSet Transformation: Identifies customers who only purchased iPhones and AirPods together.
o	Each transformation joins with the user table to retrieve customer details.
3.	Data Loading:
o	Use the LoaderFactory to specify a destination (DBFS or S3) for saving transformed data.
o	Set sink_type="dbfs" for loading to Databricks DBFS.
o	Set sink_type="s3" with appropriate access configuration for uploading to S3.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Extract, Transform, and Load Example
extractor = DataExtractor(...)  # Define appropriate extractor
data = extractor.extract()       # Extract data from CSV/Delta

# Apply transformations
transformer = FirstTransform()
transformed_data = transformer.transform(data)

# Load to DBFS
loader = LoaderFactory.get_sink_source(
    sink_type="dbfs",
    df=transformed_data,
    path="/dbfs/my_transformed_data",
    method="overwrite"
)
loader.load_data_frame()
Transformations Explained
1.	Lead and Lag Transformation:
o	Identifies customers who purchased AirPods after buying an iPhone.
o	Uses lead function for windowing operations and joins with the users table to fetch detailed user information.
2.	CollectSet Transformation:
o	Identifies customers who only purchased iPhones and AirPods together.
o	Uses collect_set for aggregation and similarly joins with the users table for user information.
Configuration Options
•	DBFS Loading: Set sink_type="dbfs" to load into Databricks DBFS.
•	S3 Loading: Set sink_type="s3" and provide the S3 path and AWS credentials for direct upload to an S3 bucket.
Conclusion
This ETL pipeline in Databricks efficiently handles data from CSV and Delta formats, applies transformations to identify customer purchase patterns, and loads transformed data to both DBFS and S3. This setup can be extended to accommodate further transformations and different storage options as needed.
